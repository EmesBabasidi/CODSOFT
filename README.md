# Codsoft Internship - Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the **Codsoft Machine Learning Internship** repository! This collection showcases the exciting and diverse projects undertaken during the internship. Each project is designed to tackle real-world challenges, offering a deep dive into the practical applications of machine learning.

## Project Highlights

### üåü Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
Ever wondered if a machine could predict the genre of a movie just by reading its plot summary? This project makes it possible! Leveraging TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and the power of a Random Forest Classifier, this model can accurately classify the genre of a movie based on its plot description. Dive in to see how machine learning meets the silver screen!

### üí≥ Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
*Status: In Progress*  
Stay tuned as we work on creating a robust model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, ensuring financial security and trust.

### üöÄ Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
Why do customers leave? This project seeks to answer that question by predicting customer churn for subscription-based services. Using historical customer data, including usage behavior and demographics, we've employed Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms to identify potential churners. Discover how businesses can retain their customers with data-driven insights.

### üì± Task 4: Spam SMS Detection
No more spam! This project focuses on building a model that can distinguish between spam and legitimate SMS messages. By using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression, we've created a filter to keep your inbox clean. Explore the intricacies of text classification and its impact on communication.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Task 5: Handwritten Text Generation
*Status: Not Started Yet*  
Imagine a machine that can generate handwritten text. This project aims to explore the fascinating intersection of machine learning and human-like text generation. Stay tuned for updates!
